    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "A Self-driving car or an autonomous car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing it's environment and navigating safely in a given space with little or no human input [1]. Although self-driving as an early concept dates back to the 1920s,\n",
    "the first self-sufficient and truly autonomous cars appeared in the 1980s. Carnegie Mellon University's Navlab and ALV projects in 1984, and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich's Eureka Prometheus Project in 1987 marked the beginning of a new era. But it wasn't until a decade ago that self-driving cars moved from the hands of government funded projects and challenges to private car manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford, BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Nissan, Toyota, and Volvo. By 2015, self-driving cars had become the topic of debate in households. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, several breakthroughs and advancements later, we hear about how self-drivings cars are going to be a part and parcel of the very near future. Many companies, large and small, are racing to claim the crown of having solved level 5 autonomy. Autonomous driving start-ups are rampant in the Sillicon Valley and around the US at large. It's never been a better time for the field, yet the human aspect of self-driving cars is largely under studied. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an attempt to understand and analyse the general vibe around self-driving as expressed on Twitter from May 15, 2015 to May 31, 2015. This was around the time when news was flying about Google's self-driving test initiative - [Google to begin testing purpose-built self-driving cars on public roads](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/15/google-testing-purpose-built-self-driving-cars-public-roads). Also around the same time were articles about accidents being caused by self-driving cars - [Self-driving car accidents revealed in California](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32691887).\n"

    "All the quantitative analyses shown in this notebook are easily reproducible with the right python packages and data provided in this repository. However, the qualitative analyses are a result of my personal research and inuition (and possible biases thereby). I have attached the relevant sources that support my claims and hypothesis to the best of my ability to help others audit and review my work and form independent conclusions. "
